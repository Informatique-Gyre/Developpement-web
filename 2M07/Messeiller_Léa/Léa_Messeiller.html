	<h4>WHO ARE THE BEATLES?</h4>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The core lineup of the band comprised John Lennon,<br> 
	Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are widely regarded as the most influential band in Western <br>
	popular music and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as <br>
	an art form.[1][2] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical<br>
	music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to <br>
	psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised<br> 
	many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.<br>
